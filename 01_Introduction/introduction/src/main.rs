// What is programming? 
// Programming is the process of giving machines a set of instructions that describe how  a program should be carried out. 
// Computer programming is the process of writing code that instructs how a computer,  application or software program performs. 
// At its most basic, computer programming is a set of instructions to facilitate specific  actions. 
// What is Rust? 
// Rust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language designed for  performance and safety, especially safe concurrency. 
// Rust is a systems level programming language, developed by Graydon Hoare. Mozilla  Labs later acquired the programme. 
//
//
// What is system programming? 
// Systems programming languages like C/C++ are used to build software and software  platforms. They can be used to build operating systems, game engines, compilers,  etc.  
// Systems and application programming languages face two major problems – • It is difficult to write secure code. 
// It is difficult to write multi-threaded code.
//
//
//
// Why Rust? 
// Rust focuses on three goals: 
// a. Speed  
// b. Safety  
// c. Concurrency  
// The language was designed for developing highly reliable and fast software in a simple  way. Rust can be used to write high-level programs down to hardware-specific  programs. 
// Performance  
// Rust programming language does not have a Garbage Collector (GC) by design. This  improves the performance at runtime. 
// Memory safety at compiler time. 
// Software built using Rust is safe from memory issues like dangling pointers, buffer  overruns and memory leaks. pointers, buffer overruns and memory leaks.
//
//
// Multi-threaded applications  
// Rust’s ownership and memory safety rules provide concurrency without data races. Supports for web Assembly (WASM) 
// Web Assembly helps to execute high computation intensive algorithms in the browser,  on embedded devices, or anywhere else. It runs at the speed of native code. Rust can  be compiled to Web Assembly for fast, reliable execution
